# Label Robot - Editor: Water

*Introduction*

Hello, we are Cal Poly Pomona's Robotic Team of a project known as the BANSHE. We have teamed up with Robtis and utilizing their Dynamixels, we are creating a label robot that will take will take a label and apply to a cardboard surface. 

My name is Water and I am going to be trying my best to update our team's progress biweekly. Our group was just formed not too long ago so we are try to work out the kinks and debug issues that might arise. Granted, this is going to be an ongoing project so we are bound to make mistakes here and there, however I will be fixing things up as wel go. 

If you have any questions or concerns regarding anything on this project, feel free to let us know down below and we will try our best to get back to you as soon as we can find an answer to your question. 

*Goals*

**April 9 - April 23, 2021**

1. Sofware
  - [ ] Create Development Enviroment 
  - [ ] Create Working Configuration
2. Hardware
  - [ ] Physical Design Specifications

*Steps on how to accomplish the goals* 
1. Software
    * For Software, all the intructions how how to set up the enviroment will be posted on our GitHub,
    (Add path for this in the future before turning in this blog)
    * Brief Summary of Computer Architype that we are using
        * Linux - Ubuntu
        * Nvidia Grahpics Card - ()
        * Jetson tx2 
    * Other Apps that we are using
        * Cuda - (version)
        * OpenCV - (version)
        * TensorFlow - ??? (version)
        * TeamViewer - remote testing
        * Github - storing all of our reserach

2. Hardware 
    * Mapping out the cad files using this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f_Ks42D9ClCpHORQOGnGOJ_z8osU-Fam/edit)
    * We are curretly using Solidworks to draw our CAD files, these can be accessed here... (instert things here)
    * Create a script that will test if the motors are wokring, code will be provided in the future once it has been completed, tested, and made sure that is working optimally. 

*Software* 
* As of right now, the software team is trying their best to install CUDA, OpenCV and Tensorflow onto a computer that most of the members are accessing via Team viewer. 
* We currently have CUDA and OpenCV installed, but we when are running command to test if both are integrated corretly, there seemms to be some issues regarding the path. 
* Planning to use tensorflow to help with the learning algorithm since it could be integrated with yolov3. More updates on this in the future.

*Hardware* 
* Currently waiting for the Dynamixels to be delivered to the respective members on the Hardware Team. 
* Modificaitons of the CAD is proceeding to about 50%. Adjustments are being made and should be completed soon. 

*Overall Summary on the Progress of the Group*

As of right now, the software side is still trying to set up the enviroment and have it run efficiently while the hardware side is still watiing for the parts to be deleivered to them by ROBOTIS. Hopefully by the next update, we will be able to provide more details on how far we managed to get.
