# Label Robot 

*Introduction*

Hello, we are Cal Poly Pomona, College of Engineering's Robotic Team of a project known as the BANSHEE UAV DRONE Project. We have teamed up with ROBOTIS and utilizing their Dynamixels, to create a label robot that will take a label and apply to a cardboard surface. We gratefully acknowledge the sponsor of ROBOTIS.

My name is Water and I am going to be trying my best to update our team's progress biweekly. Our group was just formed not too long ago so we are trying to work out the kinks and debug issues that might arise. Granted, this is going to be an ongoing project so we are bound to make mistakes here and there, however I will be fixing things up as we go.

*Goals*

**April 9 - April 23, 2021**

1. Software
  - [ ] Create Development Environment 
  - [ ] Create Working Configuration
2. Hardware
  - [ ] Physical Design Specifications

*Steps on how to accomplish the goals* 
1. Software
    * For Software, all the instructions how how to set up the environment will be posted on our GitHub,
    * Brief Summary of Computer Archetype that we are using
        * Linux - Ubuntu
        * Jetson tx2 
    * Other Apps that we are using!
        * CUDA - v.11.0
        * OpenCV - v.4.5.1
        * TensorFlow - v.2.4.0
        * TeamViewer - remote testing
        * Github - storing all of our research

2. Hardware 
    * Mapping out the cad files using this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f_Ks42D9ClCpHORQOGnGOJ_z8osU-Fam/edit)
    * We are currently using Solidworks to draw our CAD files, these will be updated in the future posts. 
    * Create a script that will test if the motors are working, code will be provided in the future once it has been completed, tested, and made sure that is working optimally. 
    * Hardware Components: 
      * Dynamixel XM430-W350R
      * Dynamixel Starter Kit (UD2D + U2D2 PHB Set + SMPS 12V 5A PS-10)
      * Creality Ender 3 3D Printer Fully Open Source with Resume Printing All Metal Frame FDM DIY Printers 220x220x250mm
      * Webcam - Logitech c920

*Software* 
* As of right now, the software team is trying their best to install CUDA, OpenCV and Tensorflow onto a computer that most of the members are accessing via Team viewer. 
* We currently have CUDA and OpenCV installed, but we when are running command to test if both are integrated correctly, there seems to be some issues regarding the path. 
* Planning to use Tensorflow to help with the learning algorithm since it could be integrated with Yolov3. More updates on this in the future.

*Hardware* 
* Currently waiting for the Dynamixels to be delivered to the respective members on the Hardware Team. 
* Modifications of the CAD is proceeding to about 50%. Adjustments are being made and should be completed soon. 

*Overall Summary on the Progress of the Group*

As of right now, the software side is still trying to set up the environment and have it run efficiently while the hardware side is still waiting for the parts to be delivered to them by ROBOTIS. Hopefully by the next update, we will be able to provide more details on how far we managed to get.
