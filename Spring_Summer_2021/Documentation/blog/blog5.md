# Label Robot

**Update: May 28 - June 11, 2021**

*Summary*

Hello Everyone! Lyfae here! Back with another week of updates! This week will be very brief and general since we are beginning our **INTEGRATION** between hardware and software! The robotic arm has finally been 3D printed and functional! One of our team members was able fix the broken components left by last team and is doing some test runs to see if is operating optimally. We hope that by next update we can give you more information regarding the progress of our integration. 

For the next update, it will be out on **July 2, 2021,** so keep an eye out for that!

*Hardware Updates*

* Robotic Arm
  
  * One of our team members has successfully recreated the robotic arm that was handed down to us by the previous team that worked on this project. There were some parts that had broken off and were missing so the member spent some time reprint those parts and reassemble the robotic arm. As of right now, the arm is fully function and is capable moving around and picking up a label and dropping it off at a manually chosen point. As of right now, the robotic arm is being controlled via the Dynamixel Wizard Application, but the members are finding a work around for it in the future. 

  * The Hardware team is currently, working on taking their one giant code that controls the movement of the robotic arm and them separating it into individual functions so it would be easier to debug the code and fix any bugs if any should arise. 

*Software Updates* 

* The software team is still working on *officialv5.py* and *officialv6.py* as it proves to be many bugs when interfacing with our official.py code with the server. Currently, the team is working on bug fixing them, so more information can be provided next week and we get more information regarding the progress of the fixes. 

* Inside of the software team, one group is responsible for handling the computer vision and contour detection while another group is responsible for the arm movement server. While the computer vision team is trying to debug the bugs in the previous versions of *official.py* the server team was able to come up with in-depth findings regarding trigonometric angles can be used to move the robot efficiently. As such, when the computer vision team finishes fixing all the bugs, they can integrate the trigonometric functions that the server team derived in order for the robotic arm to move exactly how we would want it to and perform the necessary tasks as efficiently as possible. 

* The `Tag Link` and the packet for *officialv5.py* and *officialv6.py* are still under development and bug testing so there won't be any files shared this update, but by next update we should have something that everyone can access.

 *Goals* 
 * Hardware:
    * The goal for the hardware team is to take their big chunk of code that controlls the robotic arm's movement and reorganize it into functions. 
    *
* Software: 
    * The goal for the software team is work on fixing the bugs because there is a lot of them. 

This is what I have for this week! See you next time!
