Software Updates for week of 7/9/2021

Calibration
-----
- Integrated image-straightening homography algorithm to correct for any camera positioning errors
- Integrated anti-distortion features using ChArUco boards (internal camera)
- Developed process for automatic calibration inside the GUI for both HSV and Camera properties

GUI
-----
- Revamped GUI and expanded design to allow for more room
- Buttons now display text that describes its function, located to the right of the button
- Functions of the arm split into 4 regions: Control, Contour Display, Calibration, and Testing. More selection options for each will arrive in the future.

Testing
-----
- Created a new testing method called "Send Packet" which will send a packet of data containing the real life measurement (in mm) of the location of the smallest contour on the frame.
- Fixed bugs that previously caused the code to crash whenever it does not see a contour.
- Improved connections to the server, will not randomly drop packets anymore and retains a secure connection for the entire time both server & client are running simultaneously.
