# Label Robot

**Update: September 3 - September 17, 2021**

*Summary*

Hello Everyone! Lyfae here! Back with another week of updates! Our group is almost done with this collaboration project! For the next couple of weeks, we will be wrapping up our work, finalize all of the documentations and work on youtube videos to show how our robot works. 

*Team Updates*

* Accomplishments: 

    - [x] Built an amplifier circuit to remotely control the air pump
    - [x] Built a test environment for the robot to interact with labels and packages
    - [x] Finalized CAD designs for the end effector    
    - [x] Integrated both hardware and software code 
    - [x] Robot recognized the difference between labels and packages
    - [x] Robot applies labels to packages successfully 
    - [x] Made a poster/presentation to the IEEE Student Engineering Technology Challenge (SETC) competition
    - [x] End effector refinements: Sealing end effector to reduce space for air to escape through end effector
    - [x] Create project poster and project presentation for IEEE Student Engineering Technology Challenge Poster
    - [x] Run the presentation and video over with Professor Yu and Andrew before the competition. 
    - [x] Test end effector by using it to pick up the labels and applying them to packages
    - [x] Record video showcasing the project for the competition


* Goals: 
    - [ ] Integrate end effector into the robot
    - [ ] Create informative videos regarding robotic project
